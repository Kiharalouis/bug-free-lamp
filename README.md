A web application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. 
The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface with features like task categorization and completion status.

Key Features:
Task Management:

Users can add tasks with a title, description, and due date.
Tasks can be edited or deleted.
Task Categorization:

Implement the ability to categorize tasks (e.g., work, personal, shopping) for better organization.
Allow users to filter tasks based on categories.
Completion Status:

Include an option to mark tasks as completed.
Provide a visual indication of completed tasks.
User Authentication:

Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and save their tasks securely.
Users should be able to log in and view their personalized task lists.

Ensure that the application is responsive and works well on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Local Storage:

Use local storage to persist tasks and user data so that users don't lose their tasks when they refresh the page.
Interactive UI:

Employ JavaScript for a dynamic and interactive user interface. For example, use animations for task transitions or add drag-and-drop functionality.
Task Sorting:

Allow users to sort tasks based on due date, priority, or other criteria.

Node.js with Express, or Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, etc. for user authentication and additional features if you want to extend the project.
Database (Optional):

MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL for storing user data and tasks.
This project will not only showcase your JavaScript skills but also your ability to create a functional and user-friendly web application. Additionally, implementing features like user authentication and data persistence will add depth to your portfolio.
